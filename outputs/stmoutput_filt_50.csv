The major findings include: First, shareholders of our paired sample of U.S. targets and foreign acquirers e experienced significantly positive combined wealth gains, $68 million on average, indicating that cross-border takeovers are generally synergy-creating activities. Second, shareholders of the U.S. targets realized significant wealth gains, regardless of the nationality of acquirers. Third, the Japanese acquisitions in our sample generated the largest net wealth gains, $398 million on average, which was shared by both target shareholders (43%) and acquirer shareholders (57%). Fourth, foreign acquirers benefitted from the targets' R&D capabilities, supporting the 'reverse-internalization' hypothesis.",Merger/Acquisition

We find that regulatory capital and liquidity creation affect each other positively after controlling for bank profitability. However, this relationship is largely driven by small banks and primarily during non-crisis periods. It is also sensitive to the level of banks regulatory capital and how it is measured. Furthermore, we find that banks which create more liquidity and exhibit higher illiquidity risk have lower profitability. Finally, the relationship between regulatory capital and bank performance is not linear and depends on the level of capitalization. Regulatory capital is negatively related to bank profitability for higher capitalized banks but positively related to profitability for lower capitalized banks. Therefore, a change in regulatory capital has differential impacts on bank performance. Our findings have various implications for policymakers and bank regulators.  2016 Elsevier Inc.",Bank Liquidity

This represented a significant change to the Australian tax framework and allows us to test the effect of differential taxation on corporate dividend policy. Consistent with the tax preference for the distribution of dividends, we find dividend initiations, all dividend payout measures and dividend reinvestment plans increased with the introduction of dividend imputation. Similarly we find that gross dividend payouts are more volatile under dividend imputation. Finally, we find that the increase in dividend payout and initiations differs across firms. In particular, we find that the higher the level of available franking tax credits the higher the firm's gross dividend payout and the more likely the firm is to initiate a dividend.  2007 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has found positive serial correlation in forecast errors, which can be attributed to underreaction to new information, especially to bad news. The relationship between an analyst's behavior and that analyst's characteristics is not clear, however, because most previous work was based solely on consensus estimates. By using detailed historical data, I found a stronger serial correlation among the herd-to-consensus analysts (that is, the group with a small average distance between their forecasts and the consensus forecast) than among other analysts. Moreover, average distance to consensus itself has a positive serial correlation, and it may be attributed to an analyst's personality (optimistic or pessimistic). I found strong positive serial correlation in the average distance to consensus among the herd-to-consensus analysts. These results show that herd-to-consensus analysts submit earnings estimates that are not only close to the consensus but are also strongly affected by their personalities.",Analyst

In the baseline case, with identical drivers and actuarially fair insurance, no-fault is stochastically dominant as long as the no-fault insurance premium exceeds the tort premium. In this case, no-fault brings a higher proportion of accident costs under insurance, increasing driver welfare. When expense charges are introduced (actuarially unfair insurance) no-fault may still be stochastically dominant if the expense charge is less under no-fault, even if no-fault weakens incentives for good driving and leads to higher accident rates. Elective no-fault is unlikely to reduce auto insurance costs, because drivers with high propensities toward moral hazard are likely to retain their fight to sue by choosing tort.",Insurance System

This study reveals what kind of firms prefer to issue FPWs rather than SEOs and why. The results reveal that issuers of FPWs are poor performers and have higher levels of information asymmetry compared to issuers of SEOs. Such firms will face higher flotation costs when issuing common stocks directly. However, the flotation costs of selling equity via FPWs are relatively fixed and irrelevant to the issuer's firm characteristics. Although the average flotation cost of FPWs is higher than that of SEOs, issuers of FPWs would face an even higher flotation cost had they conducted SEOs instead.

Innovation activities, however, drop significantly during times of policy uncertainty measured by national elections. The drop is greater for more influential innovations (citations in the right tail, exploratory rather than exploitative innovations) and for innovation-intensive industries. We use close presidential elections and ethnic fractionalization to address endogeneity concerns.

The more significant part of the high-yield spreads, 90.58%, is attributed to other risk natures of CAT bonds. Lastly, the liquidity premium increases dramatically after occurrences of severe natural catastrophes as well as during the 2008 financial crisis.  2019",Bond Market

We further analyze structural breaks of market dependences and consider the extent of their influence on such relationships. Our vine-copula results show that the dependences between the three paired markets, WTI-US, WTI-China and US-China, vary dynamically across the six identified structural break periods. In particular, the dependence between WTI-US is stronger and more volatile than that between WTI-China during most of the periods. The dependence between US-China remains at a lower level in the earlier periods, but increases in the final period. Our VAR-BEKK-GARCH results demonstrate distinctive volatility spillovers across these periods, with varying directionality, in response to the structural changes. Overall, our results indicate that the oil market stimulates rapid and continual fluctuations in market dependences, which become manifest most acutely in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 200708, demonstrating the increasing interdependence between the oil and stock markets. Further, the growing influence of China on the dynamics of these relationships, in the period following the Great Recession, presents evidence that it begins to assume an increasingly important role in global economic recovery.  2018 Elsevier Inc.",Contagion/Spillover

The classic q theory performs better in firms and years with more intangible capital: Total and even physical investment are better explained by Tobin's q and are less sensitive to cash flow.

Specifically, the study examines the impacts of cluster residential development on home value using data on Lower Gwynedd Township (Pennsylvania, USA). Other factors remaining constant, the study finds that properties located within cluster developments (CLUS) attract premium prices of roughly 3.9 %, on average, relative to properties in conventional developments. However, part of the 3.9 % price premium is attributable to the permanent open spaces which are parts and parcels of clusters. When the variable for open space (OPEN) is introduced, the cluster (CLUS) premium reduces to 2.02 % suggesting the relative importance the permanent open spaces. The open space variable (OPEN) is associated with a premium of as much as 5.2 %, on average. The density of development variable (DENSITY) is significantly negative at conventional levels. The normative implication of the density finding is that raising permitted densities, per se, in a sub-urban setting where market densities are lower than permitted densities, will have adverse impacts on home value. The results of this study provide empirical support for sustainable, greener, residential cluster development.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Residential Market

We test the three conditions for a sample of U.S. banks covering the years 20112017. All three conditions are rejected and we show that they may cause an economically relevant bias to the aggregate Lerner index, depending on the economic context.

New evidence on board functions and director compensation,"Prior research suggests that the effectiveness of corporate directors depends on their qualifications. We investigate whether directors' qualifications affect the roles they perform on the board (board functions) and their compensation. On average, directors that are more qualified handle more board functions, resulting in higher pay, but this is not true for co-opted directors (joined the board after the CEO). However, co-opted directors are assigned more functions and receive higher pay on boards where the CEO's influence is high. We also find that some firms award directors discretionary compensation (compensation that is unrelated to board functions), and that the likelihood of such compensation is correlated with CEO power. Overall, our evidence generates new insights into how director roles and financial incentives are allocated across directors, and the extent to which this allocation depends on CEO power.  2017 Elsevier B.V.",Board/Executive

Under SEC regulations, the borrower may not resell these bonds, but must retire them in a manner governed by the relevant indenture. When the only scheduled principal payment is at maturity, market purchases by the borrower have no effect on per bond value because the original cash flow pattern is not altered. In the presence of a sinking fund requirement, however, these market purchases do have an effect on bond values. The provisions of a typical sinking fund require that the borrower retire fixed principal amounts at some fixed schedule of dates either by purchasing the bonds in the open market or by calling them, by lot, at par. Any open market purchases in excess of those required are called prepurchases. Although it is not widely known, sinking fund indentures normally allow borrowers to designate prepurchased bonds, at any time, to any future sinking fund requirement. This designation option enables the borrower to alter the pattern of future cash flows. This paper discusses optimal designation policy and its effect on the value of outstanding bonds. The prevalence of sinking fund provisions and of prepurchases supports the importance of this investigation. Of industrial bonds with original maturities longer than 10 years, about 51% have sinking fund provisions. Of those with original maturities longer than 20 years, about 77% have sinking fund provisions. Furthermore, about 66% of issuers of industrial sinking fund bonds have prepurchased more than one sinking fund payment. Over 30% of these issuers have prepurchased three or more sinking fund payments. The option to designate prepurchased bonds is particularly valuable when interest rates are significantly different from the coupon rate. When interest rates are relatively low and bond prices are above par, the borrower should choose to meet sinking fund requirements by calling the required number of bonds at par. If, before exercising its call option, the borrower designates prepurchased bonds to later sinking fund dates, it lowers the amount outstanding and raises the number of bonds called away from investors at par. In this way, designation can lower the value of outstanding bonds. On the other hand, designating bonds to satisfy future sinking fund payments sacrifices those future options to call bonds at par; without the obligation to retire principal on a particular date there is no right to call bonds at par on that date. Furthermore, due to interest rate movements, it may turn out that the sacrificed options were worth quite a bit, while the options on different sinking fund dates turned out to be worthless. In other words, ex post, it might have been better to designate the prepurchased bonds to a different set of sinking fund dates. An optimal designation policy weights the benefits of raising the number of bonds called from investors against the sacrificed options and the loss of future designation flexibility. When interest rates are relatively high and bond prices are below par, the borrower should satisfy its requirements through market purchases. But accumulators, by cornering the issue, may be able to force the borrower to pay inflated prices for its bonds. If the borrower has prepurchased some bonds, however, it could designate them to the current sinking fund requirement. In this way, the borrower postpones paying off the accumulators and lowers the value of their holdings. Thus, once again, the designation option enables the borrower to reduce the value of the remaining outstanding bonds. Our paper presents an algorithm for deriving the optimal designation policy and for the valuation of sinking fund bonds in the presence of a designation option. The discussion encompasses other options commonly granted to the borrower, namely the American call option to repurchase the bond at declining strike prices and acceleration options to call multiples of the sinking fund requirement, at par, on sinking fund dates. Numerical examples are then used to illustrate that bond prices will be lower if prepurchases have been higher. The magnitude of this effect is largest when interest rates are well below the coupon rate and when accumulators have cornered the issue at a time when interest rates are well above the coupon rate. In summary, a borrower may be able to reduce the cost of servicing sinking fund debt by adopting an active prepurchase policy and by optimally designating prepurchased bonds. Similarly, investors might profit from monitoring a borrower's prepurchase and designation policies.",Remainder 1
